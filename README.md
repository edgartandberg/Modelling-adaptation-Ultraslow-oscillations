**1. Simulate LIF model:**

go to folder named second model (multiple neuron)

use network_model.m, that calls the functions LIF.m and Gen_Current.m


**2. Simulate single neuron HH model:**

go to folder named Hodgkin-Huxley_model

use singleHH.m, that calls the function  excitatory_HH.m

Swap with inhibitory_HH.m to simulate an inhibitory neuron. 


**3. Simulate network w. sequences:**

go to folder named HH_network,

use Sompolinsky_Network.m

this will need to call most of the functions in the folder
