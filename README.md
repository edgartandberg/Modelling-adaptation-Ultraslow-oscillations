# Modelling-adaptation-Ultraslow-oscillations
Project thesis at NTNU, for KISN

For now, im:

Making a single-neuron model, with the goal of generating spikes from input current.
Eventually ill adapt it to generate spikes according to an adaptation pattern, and a larger network

8.10.2024

Updating currently to simulate multiple spike trains from LIf model i built,
as well as plotting them as raster plots.

15.10.2024

Now makes a raster plot with sequences, that maps the external input. 
The next goal is to simulate internally generated oscillatory sequences, but also the interplay between delay and weights between neurons
