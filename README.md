# Modelling-adaptation-Ultraslow-oscillations
Project thesis at NTNU, for KISN

For now, im:

Making a single-neuron model, with the goal of generating spikes from input current.
Eventually ill adapt it to generate spikes according to an adaptation pattern, and a larger network

8.10.2024

Updating currently to simulate multiple spike trains from LIf model i built,
as well as plotting them as raster plots.
