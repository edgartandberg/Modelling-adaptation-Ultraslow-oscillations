# Modelling-adaptation-Ultraslow-oscillations
Project thesis at NTNU, for KISN

For now, im:

Making a single-neuron model, with the goal of generating spikes from input current.
Eventually ill adapt it to generate spikes according to an adaptation pattern, and a larger network

8.10.2024

Updating currently to simulate multiple spike trains from LIf model i built,
as well as plotting them as raster plots.

15.10.2024

Now makes a raster plot with sequences, that maps the external input. 
The next goal is to simulate internally generated oscillatory sequences, but also the interplay between delay and weights between neurons

Now submitted preliminary thesis. The goal of simulating networks is pushed to the spring, 
focus last two months have been fine tuning models for single neurons. Final version used to generate figures is latest version here.
Looking forward to the spring!

Now started my masters thesis! Good to be back. Started off looking into HH type single-neuron models,
without adaptation for now.

11.03.2025

Long time since here, after much trial and error i finally have some decent sequences from a network built on hodgkin-huxley neurons, 
by connecting the neurons in a ring. Now for some tuning!
